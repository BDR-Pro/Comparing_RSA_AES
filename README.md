# 🔐 **RSA & AES Key Generation: A Gen Z Guide** 🔐

Yo fam, welcome to the ultimate showdown between two heavyweight champs in the crypto world: RSA and AES. But guess what? They're not fighting; they're on the same squad in this script! Let’s dive into what makes them tick and how they keep our digital lives on lock.

🔒 **Encryption: The VIP Guard of the Digital World** 🔒

## 👑 RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) - The Asymmetric Bouncer

Imagine RSA as the exclusive bouncer of your digital club. It uses two keys: one public (like the address to the party) and one private (the secret handshake). This duo makes sure that only YOU can decrypt what was meant for you.
**I did it to understand why we need both**

- **Key Size**: 4089 bits – Like, majorly hefty. RSA keys are the sumo wrestlers of key sizes, ensuring strong security but taking a bit longer to get off the couch.
- **Usage**: Perfect for encrypting small bits of data, like the keys for our next contender, AES.

🕒 *Generation Time*: We time how long it takes to whip up these keys, 'cause even in the digital world, nobody likes to wait.

## 💨 AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) - The Symmetric Speedster

Now meet AES, the fast and furious of encryption. This one's all about speed and efficiency, using the same key for locking and unlocking content. It's like having a super-fast pass for all your encrypted stuff.

- **Key Size**: 256 bits – Smaller than RSA's but don't be fooled; it's like a ninja: smaller, faster, and super effective.
- **Usage**: Encrypting bulk data. Think binging your favorite series; AES ensures it's all for your eyes only, real quick.

🕒 *Generation Time*: We check how quickly AES keys can jump into action because when it comes to encryption, speed matters.

## 📈 Test & Comparison Time

Here’s where the magic happens. We run our script to generate RSA and AES keys, timing each to see who’s the speed king and who’s got the strength. It’s like comparing a sprinter to a marathon runner – both awesome, but in different lanes.

- **RSA Time Taken**: Measured in milliseconds, we see how long RSA takes to get ready for the party.
- **AES Time Taken**: Also measured in milliseconds, showing how quick AES can slip into its encryption sneakers.

## 📝 Results & Deets

After running the script, we spill the tea:

- Check out the time each key generation takes.
- Peek the private and public RSA keys (no worries, it’s just for educational vibes).
- Gaze at the AES key in all its hexadecimal glory.

We wrap it all up in a neat "result.txt" file, 'cause keeping records is key (pun intended).
